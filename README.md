## How It's Made

**Tech used:** JavaScript, EJS, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Bootstrap, Cloudinary

Sunday Dinner is a space to store, share, and pass down family recipes. A digital "recipe book" to carry along and honor the family traditions centered
around food. 

## Lessons Learned

I learned a lot about the changes that came along with Bootstrap 5 while working on this project. Many of the classes that I used within previous projects were changed with this version, and I had to rely on the docs to help me out with the new class names.

## Optimizations & Additional Features

I will continue to work on optimizing the site for mobile users as well as adding additional features such as adding functionality to allow the user to edit or delete their own recipes, adding share buttons, and possibly creating user profiles.
